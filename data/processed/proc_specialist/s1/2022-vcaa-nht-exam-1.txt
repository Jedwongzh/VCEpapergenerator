The Standard cartridge has a mean print run (the average number of pages that can be printed before all of the ink has been used up) of 2000 pages with a standard deviation of 40 pages. The mean print run of the Deluxe cartridge is 2500 pages with a standard deviation of 30 pages. The mean print run of the Elite cartridge is µE pages with a standard deviation of σE pages. The print runs of each type of cartridge are normally distributed and independent. a. Find the expected print run and the standard deviation when one Standard cartridge and one Deluxe cartridge are used in succession (that is, one is used after the other is finished). 2 marks b. One of each of the three types of cartridges is used in succession. For what values of σE is the standard deviation of the print run for this situation less than or equal to 60? 2 marks 9 2022 SPECMATH EXAM 1 (NHT) TURN OVERd o n o t w r i t e i n t h i s a r e a d o n o t w r i t e i n t h i s a r e a c.

A random sample of n Standard cartridges is selected and these cartridges are used in the printer in succession. The 95% confidence interval, using z correct to two decimal places, for the mean print run based on this sample is (1960.4, 1999.6).
