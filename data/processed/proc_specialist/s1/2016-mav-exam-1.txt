The time it takes Galaxian to run 5 km is normally distributed with a mean of 31 minutes and a standard deviation of 3 minutes. The time it takes Max to run 5 km is normally distributed with a mean of 33 minutes and a standard deviation of 4 minutes. The times run by Galaxian and Max are independent. Let the random variable X represent the time it takes Galaxian to run 5 km and let the random variable Y represent the time it takes Max to run 5 km. a. Find the standard deviation of the difference between the times it takes Max and Galaxian to run 5 km. 2 marks Max Hardcase decides to try and decrease his running times by also doing some high intensity interva 1 training. Max finds that for his next 25 runs over 5 km, the mean time is 31 minutes. Assume that the standard deviation of 4 minutes is unchanged. b. i. State appropriate nul 1 and alternative hypotheses for the running time T of Max in this situation. 1 mark ii. The p-value for this test is given by the expression )|Pr(0 HaZ≤, where Z has the standard norma 1 distribution.
