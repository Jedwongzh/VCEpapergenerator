The company claims that the lifetime of these globes is normally distributed with a mean of 200 weeks and it is known that the standard deviation of the lifetime of Shiny globes is 10 weeks. Customers have complained, saying Shiny globes were lasting less than the claimed 200 weeks. It was decided to investigate the complaints. A random sample of 36 Shiny globes was tested and it was found that the mean lifetime of the sample was 195 weeks. Use Pr(–1.96 < Z < 1.96) = 0.95 and Pr(–3 < Z < 3) = 0.9973 to answer the following questions. a. Write down the null and alternative hypotheses for the one-tailed test that was conducted to investigate the complaints. 1 mark b. i. Determine the p value, correct to three decimal places, for the test. 2 marks ii. What should the company be told if the test was carried out at the 1% level of significance? 1 mark c. The company decided to produce a new type of light globe called Globeplus. Find an approximate 95% confidence interval for the mean lifetime of the new globes if a random sample of 25 Globeplus globes is tested and the sample mean is found to be 250 weeks. Assume that the standard deviation of the population is 10 weeks. Give your answer correct to two decimal places. 1 mark 7 2021 SPECMATH EXAM 1 TURN OVERd o n o t w r i t e i n t h i s a r e a d o n o t w r i t e i n t h i s a r e a Question 4 (4 marks) a.
