SPECIALIST MATHEMATICS Tria 1 written examination 1 (Facts, skills and applications) 2005 Reading time: 15 minutes Writing time : 1 hour 30 minutes PART II QUESTION AND ANSWER BOOK This examination has two parts: Part 1 (multiple-choice questions) and Part I 1 (short-answer questions). Part 1 consists of a separate question book and must be answered on the answer sheet provided for multiple-choice questions. Part I 1 consists of this question and answer book. You must complete both parts in the time allotted. When you have completed one part continue immediately to the other part.

A decima 1 approximation wil 1 not be accepted if an exact answer is required to a question. Where an exact answer is required to a question, appropriate working must be shown. In questions where more than one mark is available, appropriate working must be shown. Where an instruction to use calculus is stated for a question, you must show an appropriate derivative or anti-derivative. Unless otherwise indicated, the diagrams in this book are not drawn to scale.
