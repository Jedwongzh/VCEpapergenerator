The mass, in grams, of peaches produced on this farm is known to be normally distributed with a variance of 16. A bag of 25 peaches is found to have a total mass of 2625 g. Based on this sample of 25 peaches, calculate an approximate 95% confidence interval for the mean mass of all peaches produced on this farm. Use an integer multiple of the standard deviation in your calculations.
