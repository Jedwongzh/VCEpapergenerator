The waiting time, in minutes, for clients using the helpline is normally distributed with mean μ. A random sample is taken of 100 of the company’s c 1 ients who use the helpline and an approximate 95% confidence interva 1 for μ is 98 .16 02 .15 <<μ . a. Find the mean x and the standard deviation s for this sample. 2 marks The company upgrades its telephone helpline by outs ourcing it to a cal 1 centre business. The waiting times, in minutes, for callers to this cal 1 centre are normally distributed with an advertised mean waiting time of 5.2 minutes and a s tandard deviation of 1.5 minutes. After the upgrade, the company is suspicious that t he waiting times on average are longer than those suggested by the advertising. It randomly sam ples 25 of its clients and finds that the mean waiting time is 5.8 minutes. Assume that the p opulation standard deviation remains at 1.5 minutes. b. i. Write down appropriate nul 1 and alternative hypoth eses to test whether the mean waiting time is longer than that advertised by the cal 1 centre business. 1 mark ii. Find the p value for this test. 2 marks iii. Hence explain whether or not the nul 1 hypothesis sh ould be rejected or not rejected at the 5% leve 1 of significance. 1 mark 6 © THE HEFFERNAN GROUP 2016 Specialist Maths 3 & 4 Tria 1 Exam 1 Question 6 (3 marks) Evaluate ∫π 4 02)2 (sin )(cos dx x x . Question 7 (3 marks) The region in the first quadrant enclosed by the gr aph with equation 43 2+= xy , the coordinate axes and the line with equation x=2, is rotated about the x–axis to form a solid of revolution. a. Write down a definite integra 1 that gives the volum e of this solid of revolution. 1 mark b. Find the volume of the solid of revolution. 2 marks 7 © THE HEFFERNAN GROUP 2016 Specialist Maths 3 & 4 Tria 1 Exam 1 Question 8 (5 marks) Consider the three vectors . where 3 and 4 ,2 2 ~~ ~ ~~~ ~~~~ ~Rm ji c kjmibkji a ∈ +−= − += −+= a.
