The volume of ice cream dispensed is normally distributed with a mean of 125 mL and a standard deviation of 4 mL. The volume of chocolate topping dispensed is normally distributed and has a mean of 20 mL and a standard deviation of 3 mL. The volume of chocolate topping dispensed is independent of the volume of ice cream dispensed. a. What is the probability that a bow 1 of ice cream with chocolate topping has a tota 1 volume more than 155 mL? Use Pr( 2 2) 0.9545 Z−< < = , where Z is the standard norma 1 variable and give your answer correct to three decima 1 places . 2 marks b. If the cost of ice cream is $11 per litre and the cost of chocolate topping is $15 per lit re, what is the mean tota 1 cost, correct to the nearest cent, of a bow 1 of ice cream with chocolate topping? 2 marks 4 __________________________________________________________________ © THE HEFFERNAN GROUP 2024 Specialist Maths Units 3 & 4 tria 1 exam 1 Question 4 (3 marks) Prove using mathematica 1 induction that 27 9 11 ....
