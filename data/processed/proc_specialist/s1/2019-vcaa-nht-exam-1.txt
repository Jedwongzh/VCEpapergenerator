Take the acceleration due to gravity to have magnitude g ms–2, where g = 9.8 Question 1 (4 marks)A 10 kg mass is placed on a rough plane that is inclined at 30° to the horizontal, as shown in the diagram below. A force of 40 N is applied to the mass up the slope and paralle 1 to the slope. There is also a frictiona 1 resistance force of magnitude F that opposes the motion of the mass. 30°10 kg a. Find the magnitude of th e frictiona 1 resistance force, in newtons, acting up the slope if the force is just sufficient to stop the mass from sliding down the slope. 2 marks b. An additional force of magnitude P newtons is applied to the mass up the slope and paralle 1 to the slope. The sum of the additiona 1 force and the frictiona 1 resistance force of magnitude F that now acts down the slope is such that it is just sufficient to stop the mass from sliding up the slope.

Given that a solution of p(z) = 0 is z 1 = 3 – 2 i and that p(–2) = 0, find the values of b, c and d. Question 3 (4 marks) The number of cars per day making a U-turn at a particular location is known to be normally distributed with a standard deviation of 17.5. In a sample of 25 randomly selected days, a total of 1450 cars were observed making the U-turn. a. Based on this sample, calculate an approximate 95% confidence interva 1 for the number of cars making the U-turn each day. Use an integer multiple of the standard deviation in your calculations. 3 marks b. The average number of U-turns made at the location is actually 60 per day. Find an approximation, correct to two decima 1 places, for the probability that on 25 randomly selected days the average number of U-turns is less than 53. 1 mark 5 2019 SPECMATH EXAM 1 (NHT) TURN OVERd o n o t w r i t e i n t h i s a r e a d o n o t w r i t e i n t h i s a r e a Question 4 (3 marks) Evaluate 1 34 x (x)dx e ee log.∫ Question 5 (5 marks) A triangle has vertices AB C (, ,),( ,, )( ,, ). 31 24 12 32 23 3 +− −− + and a.
