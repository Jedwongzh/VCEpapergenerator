Question 2 (3 marks) A company sells large pump pack containers of sunsc reen. A random sample of 100 of these containers is taken. The pump mechanism of each co ntainer is tested by pumping it once. The tota 1 volume of sunscreen dispensed from these 100 containers is 2150 mL, with a variance of 4 mL for each container. Assume that the variance obtained from the sample i s a sufficiently accurate estimate of the population variance. Calculate a 95% confidence interva 1 for the mean vo lume of sunscreen dispensed, when pumped once, for this brand and size of sunscreen. Use an integer multiple of z in your calculations. 3 © THE HEFFERNAN GROUP 2017 Specialist Maths 3 & 4 Tria 1 Exam 1 Question 3 (4 marks) Relative to an origin O, point A has Cartesian coordinates (1,−2,2) and point B has Cartesian coordinates (2,1,−3). a.
