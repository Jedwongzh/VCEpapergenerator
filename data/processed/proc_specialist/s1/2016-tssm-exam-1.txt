Question 1 (4 marks) In a toy factory a sample of 121 toy cars are tested. The cars are moving on a straight line track. It is found that the dragging force produced by the battery is four times the mass of the c ar in grams . The resistance force is three times the speed of the car in metres per minute. The mass of the cars are normally distributed with a mean 200 grams and standard deviation of 3 grams. The speed is also normally distributed with a mean 80 metres per minute and a standard deviation of 4 metres. Assume that the mass and speed are independent. a. Find the expected value and the standard deviation of the resultant force. 3 marks b. Find the standard deviation of the mean of the resultant force for the sample. 1 mark TURN OVER 2016 SPECIALIST MATHEMATICS EXAM 1  TSSM 2016 Page 4 of 11 Question 2 (3 marks) Let O, A and B be three non-collinear points on a plan e. .
