Find the mean x and the standard deviation s for this sample. 2 marks The company upgrades its telephone helpline by outs ourcing it to a cal 1 centre business. The waiting times, in minutes, for callers to this cal 1 centre are normally distributed with an advertised mean waiting time of 5.2 minutes and a s tandard deviation of 1.5 minutes. After the upgrade, the company is suspicious that t he waiting times on average are longer than those suggested by the advertising. It randomly sam ples 25 of its clients and finds that the mean waiting time is 5.8 minutes. Assume that the p opulation standard deviation remains at 1.5 minutes. b. i.

The waiting time, in minutes, for clients using the helpline is normally distributed with mean μ. A random sample is taken of 100 of the company’s c 1 ients who use the helpline and an approximate 95% confidence interva 1 for μ is 98 .16 02 .15 <<μ . a. Find the mean x and the standard deviation s for this sample. 2 marks The company upgrades its telephone helpline by outs ourcing it to a cal 1 centre business. The waiting times, in minutes, for callers to this cal 1 centre are normally distributed with an advertised mean waiting time of 5.2 minutes and a s tandard deviation of 1.5 minutes. After the upgrade, the company is suspicious that t he waiting times on average are longer than those suggested by the advertising. It randomly sam ples 25 of its clients and finds that the mean waiting time is 5.8 minutes. Assume that the p opulation standard deviation remains at 1.5 minutes. b. i.

The company claims that the lifetime of these globes is normally distributed with a mean of 200 weeks and it is known that the standard deviation of the lifetime of Shiny globes is 10 weeks. Customers have complained, saying Shiny globes were lasting less than the claimed 200 weeks. It was decided to investigate the complaints. A random sample of 36 Shiny globes was tested and it was found that the mean lifetime of the sample was 195 weeks. Use Pr(–1.96 < Z < 1.96) = 0.95 and Pr(–3 < Z < 3) = 0.9973 to answer the following questions. a. Write down the null and alternative hypotheses for the one-tailed test that was conducted to investigate the complaints. 1 mark b. i.
