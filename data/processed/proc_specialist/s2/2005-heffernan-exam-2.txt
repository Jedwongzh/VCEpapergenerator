At the top of the ramp is a horizonta 1 floor. The box is attached to one end of a rope that passe s over a smooth pulley and is held at the other end by a man. The man exerts a constant pulling force of 200 N on the rope. The coefficient of friction between the box and the ramp is 3. a. Find the acceleration of the box up the ramp. 4 marks °30 5 © THE HEFFERNAN GROUP 2005 Specialist Maths Tria 1 Exam 2 b. Given that the box started from rest at the lower e nd of the ramp, how long does it take for the box to be hauled halfway up the ramp? Express your answer as an exact value. 2 marks c. When the box is at this point, halfway up the ramp, the man lets go of the rope and the box becomes stationary. Draw a diagram showing al 1 the forces acting on the box and explain whether or not the box is at the point of slipping down the ramp. 3 marks 6 © THE HEFFERNAN GROUP 2005 Specialist Maths Tria 1 Exam 2 7 © THE HEFFERNAN GROUP 2005 Specialist Maths Tria 1 Exam 2 d. If the coefficient of friction between the ramp and the box was 21, the box would slide down the ramp once stationary after the man let go of the rope. How far would the box trave 1 in this situation in the first second af ter coming to rest? Express your answer to the nearest centimetre. 3 marks Tota 1 12 marks 8 © THE HEFFERNAN GROUP 2005 Specialist Maths Tria 1 Exam 2 Question 3 The rate of change in the temperature T, in degrees C, in a living room, t hours after a heater is switched on is given by 0, 4002≥−= tTdtdT The temperature in the living room at the time that the heater was turned on was ()°310 (approximately ∘3217⋅). a.
