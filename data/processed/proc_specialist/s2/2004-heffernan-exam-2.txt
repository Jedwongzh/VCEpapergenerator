It has a n arm that can be retracted or extended. The arm of the crane can be rotated in such a way t hat the points in space that can be reached by the end of the arm of the crane form a solid in the shape of an inverted cone with a curved top, as shown in the diagram below. Point O corresponds to the base of the crane. Let and ~~ji be unit vectors in the direction of the right hand side and front end respectively of t he truck. Let ~kbe a unit vector in the vertically upwards direction. Points A, B, C and D lie on the edge of the outer ring of the solid. The coordinates of the points in and on the solid s hape are given in relation to point O and the unit is metres. a. What is the highest point vertically above the base of the crane that the crane can reach when inclined at its maximum angle from the v ertical?

The meta 1 chute which is 2 m long, is on an angle o f °45 with the horizonta 1 as shown in the diagram below. The coefficient of friction between a lolly and the meta 1 chute is 0.5. The forces acting on a lolly, (each of which have a mass of 0.025 kg) as it slides down the meta 1 chute are the weight force, the norma 1 reacti on and the friction force. a. On the diagram below, show the forces acting on a 1 olly. 1 mark b.
