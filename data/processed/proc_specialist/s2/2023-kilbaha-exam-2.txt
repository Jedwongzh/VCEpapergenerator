Over a long time period of time the company has noted t hat the weight of a party pie is normally distributed with a mean of 47 grams, with a standard deviation of 3 grams and the weight of a sausage rol 1 is normally distributed with a mean of 37.5 grams, with a standard deviation of 2 grams. a. At a party Jared serves party pies and sausage rolls. The probability that the tota 1 weight of p party pies and s sausage rolls exceeding 1578 grams is 0.5 . The percentage of the tota 1 weight of p party pies and s sausage rolls being less than 1560 gra ms is 13.397% . Assuming that the weights of party pies and s ausage rolls are independ ent, determine how many party pies and sausage rolls Jared served at the party. 3 marks ___________________________________________________________________________ ___________________________________________________________________________ ___________________________________________________________________________ _________________________ __________________________________________________ ___________________________________________________________________________ ___________________________________________________________________________ Following a change in production of the party pie s, the company is not sure if they are putting enough meat in their party pies and are concerned that they could be underweight. To check this they sampled 36 party pies and found that the mean mass of the sample of 46.3 grams, assume that the standard deviation is stil 1 3 grams. b. Write down suitable hypothesis 0 H and 1 H for this test. 1 mark ___________________________________________________________________________ ___________________________________________________________________________ c.

Following a change in production of the sausage rolls, it is found that the mean weights of the sausage rolls has been reduced to 36.5 grams with the standard deviation remaining the same. A statistica 1 test to check whether there is any evidence of a 1.0 gram reduction in the mean mass of the sausage rolls is undertaken. The test st atistic wil 1 be the mean weight of 36 sausage rolls. The test is conducted at the 5% leve 1 of significance. Determine the value of the Type I 1 error () for this test, giving your answer as a percentage correct to one decima 1 pla ce. 2 marks ___________________________________________________________________________ ___________________________________________________________________________ ___________________________________________________________ ________________ ___________________________________________________________________________ END OF SECTION B 2023 Kilbaha VCE Specialist Mathematics Tria 1 Examination 2 Section B Page 28 © Kilbaha Education https://kilbaha.com.au This page must be counted in surveys by Copyright Agency Limited (CAL) http://copy right.com.au EXTRA WORKING SPACE ________________________________________________________________________ ________________________________________________________________________ ________________________________________________________________________ ______________________________ __________________________________________ ________________________________________________________________________ ________________________________________________________________________ ___________________________________________________________________ _____ ________________________________________________________________________ ________________________________________________________________________ ________________________________________________________________________ _______________________________ _________________________________________ ________________________________________________________________________ ________________________________________________________________________ ____________________________________________________________________ ____ ________________________________________________________________________ End of question and answer book for the 2023 Kilbaha VCE Specialist Mathematics Tria 1 Examination 2 Kilbaha Education PO Box 2227 Kew Vic 3101 Australia Tel: (03) 9018 5376 kilbaha@gmail.com https://kilbaha.com.au 2023 Kilbaha VCE Specialist Mathematics Tria 1 Examination 2 © Kilbaha Education https://kilbaha.com.au This page must be counted in surveys by Copyright Agency Limited (CAL) http://copy right.com.au SPECIALIST MATHEMATICS Written examination 2 FORMULA SHEET Directions to students Detach this formula sheet during reading time.
