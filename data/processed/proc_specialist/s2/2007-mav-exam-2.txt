Question 13 Answer D A point of inflection occurs where the second derivative is zero and the first derivative does not change sign. So, at the point of inflection dxd y 22 changes sign and dxdy does not change sign. Question 14 Answer C A stationary point of inflection occurs at x 1=- since f x 0= l]g and the derivative of f xl]g is zero as wel 1 at that point. f xl]g changes from negative to positive through zero at x 2= and so there is a loca 1 minimum at this point for the graph of y f x=]g.
