To heat the bottle, Nick puts it in a saucepan of continuously boiling water. Let y°C be the temperature of the milk at time t minutes after the baby’s bottle is placed in the boiling water. A differentia 1 equation that models the increase in temperature of the milk while the bottle is in the boiling water is dy dta y= −( )100 where a > 0. a. The milk’s temperature when the bottle is put into the boiling water is 5°C. Solve the differentia 1 equation to show that y = 100 – 95 e–at for 0 t T, where T is the time when Nick takes the bottle out of the boiling water. 4 marks When Nick takes the bottle out of the boiling water at time T, the temperature of the milk is 48°C. He realises that this is too hot to give to baby Alex and so he puts the bottle into cold water. The temperature of the cold water is 10°C and the milk cools according to Newton’s law of cooling: dy dtb y= −−( )10 where b > 0. b. Verify, by differentiation, that for t ≥ T, y = 10 + Ae–b(t – T), and evaluate A. 3 marks Question 5 – continuedSPECMATH EXAM 2 14 15 SPECMATH EXAM 2 Nick lets the milk coo 1 to a temperature of 36°C to give to baby Alex. It takes three times as long for the milk to coo 1 to this temperature from 48°C as it previously took to heat up from 5°C to 48°C. c. Sketch a graph of y in terms of t from when the baby’s bottle is put into the boiling water to when the milk is ready to give to baby Alex. 3 marks d.
