A decima 1 approximation wil 1 not be accepted if an exact answer is required to a question. Where an exact answer is required to a question, appropriate working must be shown. In questions where more than one mark is available, appropriate working must be shown. Where an instruction to use calculus is stated for a question, you must show an appropriate derivative or anti-derivative. Unless otherwise indicated, the diagrams in this book are not drawn to scale.

She estimated that the rate at which the penguin population was decreasing was proportiona 1 to the number of penguins on the island at the time. Let N be the number of penguins on the island t years after the study began. A differentia 1 equation that models the decreasing penguin population over time is given by –– = kN where k < 0. a.At the time the study began there were 700 penguins on the island. Solve the differentia 1 equation to show that N = 700 ekt. 2 marks b. Two years after the study began, the penguin population had fallen to 550. Find the value of k correct to two decima 1 places. 1 markMAV SPECMATH EXAMINATION 1/2005 Question 4 – continued TURN OVER 11 c.Assume this trend continues. How many years after the study began wil 1 there be fewer than 50 penguins on the island? 1 mark By the start of the third year, penguin numbers on the island had fallen to 488. The researcher wanted to arrest this decline. At the start of the third year and each year thereafter, she relocated P penguins of the same species to the island from another location. A differentia 1 equation that models the changing penguin population on the island over time is given by dN given by –– = P + mN where m < 0, t ≥ 3 (P + 488 m)e m(t – 3) – P d. Solve the differentia 1 equation to show that N = –––––––––––––––– 3 marks e.iIf P = 60 and m = – 0.05, find the number of penguins on the island eight years after the study began. ii.Determine an upper limit to the number of penguins the island can sustain in the longer term. 1 + 1 = 2 marks f. Suppose that in the longer term the island can sustain fewer than 800 penguins. Determine a relationship between P and m so that this may occur. 2 marks Tota 1 11 marksMAV SPECMATH EXAMINATION 1/2005 Question 5 – continued 12 a.Find, correct to one decima 1 place, the Norma 1 reaction force, N, that the ground exerts on the backpack, when it is sliding down the embankment. 1 mark Five metres down the embankment, the backpack collides with a smal 1 bush of mass 3 kg, which the sliding backpack rips out of the ground. b.iIf the backpack is travelling at a speed of 8 m/s when it collides with the bush, find the acceleration down the slope of the backpack. 1 mark ii Find, correct to two decima 1 places, the coefficient of friction, µ, between the backpack and the ground. 2 marksQuestion 5 Bushwalking in the Victorian Alps, Scott is walking along a narrow track high above the Howqua River, carrying a 35 kg backpack. Scott stops on the track and removes his backpack to take a short rest. Unfortunately, Scott slips and his backpack slides down an embankment inclined at an angle of 60° to the horizontal.
