After a thunderstorm, the funga 1 infection spreads rapidly through the remaining apricots. Therate of spread of the fungus is dependent on the number of infected apricots and the number ofapricots yet to be infected. This infestation can be modelled by the equation: dtkA A=− ()2000 , where A is the tota 1 number of infected apricots, t days after the thunderstorm. a. i.
