A decima 1 approximation wil 1 not be accepted if an exact answer is required to a question. In questions where more than one mark is available, appropriate working must be shown. Where an instruction to use calculus is stated for a question, you must show an appropriate derivative or antiderivative. Unless otherwise indicated, the diagrams in this book are not drawn to scale. Take the acceleration due to gravity to have magnitude g m/s 2, where g = 9.8.SPECMATH EXAM 2 2 3 SPECMATH EXAM 2 Question 1 The velocity-time graph below shows the velocity of a lift as it travels from the first floor to the twelfth floor of a tal 1 building during the T seconds of its motion. The velocity v m/s at time t s for 0 ≤ t ≤ 2 is given by v = t 2(3 – t). After the first two seconds, the lift moves with a constant velocity of 4 m/s for a time, and then decelerates to rest in the fi na 1 two seconds. The acceleration of the lift is a m/s 2 at time t s, and the velocity-time graph is symmetrica 1 about t = 1 2 T. a. i. Express a in terms of t for the first two seconds of the motion of the lift. 1 mark ii.

It begins its journey at exactly the same time as the first lift. At al 1 times during their motions, both lifts move with the same speed. Exactly one second after the two lifts begin to move, the reaction force on a boy standing in the second lift is equa 1 in magnitude to the reaction force on the gir 1 in the fi rst lift. i.
