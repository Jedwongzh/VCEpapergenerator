The bay in which the shellfish are farmed is very calm so that the water surface is flat. The company has partitioned the bay into pens using nets paralle 1 to eachother and 150 metres apart. The nets extend 60 metres from the straight shoreline and are perpendicular to it. InFigure 1, OB is one such net. Figure 1 The shape of the seabed can be modelled by yxx =+ ( ) – sin 508 , where x metres is the perpendicular distance from the shoreline and y metres is the vertica 1 displacement. The vertica 1 cross-section of the water paralle 1 to the net OB is the shape of the shaded region in Figure 2. Figure 2150 mshoreline pens 60 mO O By x 9 SPECMATH EXAM 2 b. i.
