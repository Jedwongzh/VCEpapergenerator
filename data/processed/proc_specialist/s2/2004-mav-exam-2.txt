There are no native emus on Sedgwickus, and no attempt was made to recapture the birds.An emu only lays one clutch of eggs each year, but lays multiple eggs. The growth rate of the population of emus on Sedgwickus can be modelled by the differentia 1 equation dtkN= , where N is the number of emus present at time t years . a Show that the solution to this differentia 1 equation can be expressed in the form Nekt=10 . (3 marks) b By January 1 st, 2002, the flock of emus has increased to 70 birds. Show that k=1 27 ln. (1 mark) c If the flock of emus continues to increase in numbers, what does this mode 1 predict the size of the flock to be after 5 years? (1 mark)MAV Specialist Mathematics Examination 2, 2004 © The Mathematica 1 Association of Victoria Page 6 d According to this mode 1 of the population growth of the emus, how long, to the nearest year, wil 1 it take for the emu population to exceed 10 000 birds? (2 marks) The mode 1 of unrestrained exponentia 1 population growth is unrealistic, as the island of Sedgwickus can only support 6 000 emus. A modified exponentia 1 growth mode 1 is proposed, where the rate ofpopulation growth is jointly proportiona 1 to the number of emus present, N, and the difference between the upper limit and the number present, according to: dtkN N= − ()6000 ei Show that a solution to this differentia 1 equation can be expressed as: kt= +6000 16000 6000 ii Hence, or otherwise, find the exact value of A.

(3 marks) d Whilst he was at checkpoint B, Les removed his hat to scratch his head. It wasn’t unti 1 he was back at O that Les realised his hat was back at B and that he would have to repeat part of the course in order to retrieve his hat. He remembered when he got back to A, that the path fromA to B was very rocky. An alternative path to B which avoided the rocky section, was to leave A and walk paralle 1 to BC/combarrowextender/arrowrightnosp/combarrowextender/combarrowextender , then cut across perpendicularly to checkpoint B. If Les follows this alternative path when leaving checkpoint A, how far, to the nearest metre, would he walk before turning perpendicularly towards B?

One of these toys is a plastic man named Arnie Schwartzasplatter whose plastic componentscome apart if you drop him on the floor. A plastic ring is attached to Arnie, through which is tiedan inelastic string which passes over a smooth pulley to an attached mass of 9 grams, as shownbelow. Arnie himself has a mass of 25 grams. The objective with this toy, is to have Arnie waddle to the end of the table, topple over the pulley, splatter on the floor and fal 1 to pieces. Arnie can then be put back together. a Lisa places Arnie on a flat wooden table. The co-efficient of friction between Arnie and the table is 0.20. Assume g = 9.8 m/s 2. Find, correct to 3 decima 1 places; i Arnie’s acceleration along the table. ii The tension in the string.

She places him 0.5 m from the edge of the desk and measures with a stopwatch that it takes Arnie 2 seconds from when he is releasedto reach the edge of the table. Calculate, correct to 3 decima 1 places, the co-efficient of frictionbetween Arnie and Lisa’s desktop.
