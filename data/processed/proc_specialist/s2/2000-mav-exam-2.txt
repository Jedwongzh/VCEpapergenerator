[2 marks] Tota 1 10 marks Question 3 Dangerous Dan leaps across a pit after riding his m otorcycle up a ramp. He reaches a speed of 17 m/s at the point F (the bo ttom of the ramp) and decelerates at 2 m/s 2 as he travels up the ramp, whose length is 4 m. The combined mass of the motorcycle and Dan is 250 kg. The coefficient of friction between Dan’ s motorcycle and the ramp is 0.1. Throughout this question, assume air resistance is n egligible, and take the acceleration due to gravity to have magnitude g m/s 2, where g = 9.8. a. On the diagram below, indicate al 1 the forces on the Dan and his motorcycle as it travels up the ramp.

What is the magnitude of the force generated by the motorcycle, to the nearest newton, as it travels up the ramp? [3 marks] c. What is the velocity of the motorcycle when it reac hes the point T (the top of the ramp). [2 marks] d. At the instant after Dan leaves the ramp, his accele ration is r•• (t) = – gj ~. Express the velocity of Dan and his motor cycle in the form of r•(t) = x•(t)i~+ y•(t)j~, where i~and j~are the horizonta 1 and vertica 1 components of the v elocity, as he leaves the ramp, and tis time in seconds from t= 0.

Luij has been down at the waterhole, which i s 100 metres inside the golf course recovering golf balls that have been lost by waywar d golf shots. Luij looks at his watch and realises that he is late home for lunch. He needs t o find the quickest way home from the waterhole ( W), across the golf course and through the forest to his home ( H). Luij can run at 5 m/s across the golf course but can only trave 1 at 3 m/s through the rough forest.

What distance, to the nearest metre, wil 1 Luij have t o trave 1 if he runs from Wto Eacross the golf course and then from Eto Hto reach home? (Assume the forest extends past Luij ’s home, beyond EH .) ii. If he follows this route, how long, in minutes and seco nds, wil 1 it take Luij to arrive home? [3 marks] b. i. If Luij takes the direct route home from Wto H, how far, to the nearest metre wil 1 he run? ii . How long wil 1 it take Luij if he takes this direct route?
