However, she now walks up a steep slope inclined at a constant angle of Sin–1(0.28) to the horizontal. c. i. Chris reaches a point R which is 0.5 km up the slope from Q. Find OR→ in terms of i~, j ~ and k~. 2 marks ii.At R, Chris falls and twists an ankle. She has an emergency radio transmitter with a maximum range of 10 km. Determine whether her transmitter has sufficient range to alert the park ranger at O. 2 marks Tota 1 11 marks TURN OVER SPECMATH EXAM 2 6 Question 2 An oi 1 tanker hits a reef and spills oi 1 into the sea. Initially the oi 1 spills at an increasing rate, but action by the crew and coasta 1 authorities enables the spil 1 to be brought under contro 1 some time later. Assume that the oil spills from the tanker at the rate of kt t 124+ litres/day, where k = 106 and t is the time in days from when the oil tanker hit the reef. a.Find the rate, in litres/day, at which the oi 1 spills into the sea after 4 days, correct to three significant figures. 1 mark b. i. If the rate at which oi 1 spills into the sea has a maximum value when t = a, find the exact value of a. 3 marks ii.Hence or otherwise find the maximum rate at which oi 1 spills into the sea, in litres/day, correct to three significant figures. 1 mark Question 2 – continued 7 SPECMATH EXAM 2 TURN OVERc. i. Use the substitution u = t 2 to find an antiderivative of t t 124+. 3 marks ii.If V litres is the volume of oi 1 spilled into the sea in the first t days, find V in terms of t. 1 mark iii.Some time after the oi 1 began to spil 1 into the sea, a newspaper report stated that: ‘It is expected that eventually 300 000 litres of the tanker’s oi 1 wil 1 have spilled into the sea’. Determine whether the newspaper report statement is in agreement with the mode 1 above. 2 marks Tota 1 11 marks SPECMATH EXAM 2 8 Question 3 – continuedOy –2 –1 1 2 –1 –22 1 Question 3 a.On the axes provided, sketch the curve given by the rule x 2 – 4 y 2 = 1. 2 marks The part of the curve for x ≥ 1 and 0 ≤ y ≤ 1 is rotated about the y-axis to form a volume of revolution which is to mode 1 an ornamenta 1 fountain. b.When the depth of the water in the fountain is h metres, show that the volume of water in the fountain is Vcubic metres, where Vhh =+π()4 33 . 2 marks 9 SPECMATH EXAM 2 The fountain is initially empty. Water is pumped into it at a rate of 0.003 cubic metres per second. At the same time, water flows out from the bottom of the fountain at a rate of 0.004 h cubic metres per second, where hmetres is the depth of the water in the fountain. c.Find the rate, in metres per second, at which the depth is increasing when the depth is 0.25 metres. Give your answer correct to two significant figures. 3 marks d.Express the time taken for the depth to rise to 0.5 metres as a definite integra 1 and evaluate it correct to the nearest second. 2 marks e.At what depth does the water ultimately stabilise in the fountain? 2 marks Tota 1 11 marks TURN OVER SPECMATH EXAM 2 10 Question 4 – continuedQuestion 4 a.Find the roots of z 2 – 6 z + 25 = 0 where z ∈ C, and hence find the sum of the roots and the product of the roots. 3 marks b.Let u and v be the roots of the equation z 2 + bz + c = 0 where b, c, z ∈ C. i.Show that u + v = –b and uv = c. 2 marks ii.Hence show that if u = p + qi where p, q ∈ R, and u and v are complex conjugates, then b and c are real. 2 marks 11 SPECMATH EXAM 2 c.Find the quadratic equation in z which has roots 25+i and −+25 i. 2 marks d.A quadratic equation in z has roots u and v.
