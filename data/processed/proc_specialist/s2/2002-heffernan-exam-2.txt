He kicks at a goal, which is in the shape of a rectangular prism, 4 metres wide, 1 metre deep and 2 metres hig h. He kicks from point O, which is 24 metres from point S on the backline and 3 metres to the left of the lef t hand goa 1 post. OS is perpendicular to the backline. Chris kicks the bal 1 in a straight line and hits th e top right hand corner of the goa 1 at point P. Point Q is the bottom right hand corner of the goa 1 and is vertically below P. Let ~i be the unit vector which runs paralle 1 with the ba ckline, let ~j be the unit vector which runs paralle 1 to the length of the ground and let ~k be the unit vector which runs vertically upwards. Let point O be the origin. a. i . Express → OQ in terms of ~i and ~j. 1 mark ii. Express → OP in terms of ~i, ~j and ~k. 1 mark ~i~j~k 3 ___________________________________________________ ________________________ © THE HEFFERNAN GROUP 2002 Specialist Maths Exam 2 b. i . Show that the vector component of → OP, perpendicular to → OQ, is ~2 k. 2 marks ii. Hence or otherwise find → PQ. 2 marks 4 ___________________________________________________ ________________________ © THE HEFFERNAN GROUP 2002 Specialist Maths Exam 2 Chris has a second shot at goa 1 from the same point O. This time he plays an identica 1 shot but a team mate makes contact with the bal 1 when it is 1.5 metres vertically above the ground at point R. With his head, this team mate deflects the bal 1 in a straight line to point T, which is in the back left hand corner of the goal. c.
