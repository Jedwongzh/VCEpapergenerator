SPECMATH EXAM 2 2 Answer al 1 questions in the spaces provided. A decima 1 approximation wil 1 not be accepted if an exact answer is required to a question. Where an exact answer is required to a question, appropriate working must be shown. Where an instruction to use calculus is stated for a question, you must show an appropriate derivative or antiderivative. Unless otherwise indicated, the diagrams in this book are not drawn to scale. Take the acceleration due to gravity to have magnitude g m/s 2, where g = 9.8. Working space 3 SPECMATH EXAM 2 Question 1 The diagram shows a straight shoreline with a town at O.

The surfer’s feet are strapped to the board. A surfer is pulled in a straight line across leve 1 water by a kite. The kite is connected to the surfer by a rope that makes an angle of θ° to the horizontal. The coefficient of friction between the water and the board is 0.3, and the combined mass of the surfer and board is 80 kg. A mode 1 for this situation is shown in the following diagram, where the term ‘kite surfer’ refers to the surfer and board. a.On the diagram, indicate and labe 1 the following forces which act on the kite surfer. the weight force, of magnitude 80 g newtons the norma 1 reaction, of magnitude N newtons the friction force, of magnitude F newtons the tension in the rope, of magnitude T newtons 1 mark The kite surfer is accelerating at 2 m/s 2.

Find the acceleration (in m/s 2) of the dragster over the 400 metres. 1 mark ii.Show that the dragster reaches a speed of 100 m/s at the end of the 400 metre course. 1 mark Question 3 – continued TURN OVER SPECMATH EXAM 2 10 At the 400 metre mark, the dragster stops accelerating. At this instant, the dragster’s brakes are applied and, in addition, a smal 1 parachute opens at the rear to slow the car down. The retarding force applied by the brakes (including friction) is 5000 N. The retarding force due to the parachute is 0.5 v 2 N where v m/s is the velocity of the car x metres beyond the 400 metre mark. The mass of the dragster (car and driver) is 400 kg. b. i.
