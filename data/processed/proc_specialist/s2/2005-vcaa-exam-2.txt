One side of each fence pane 1 needs to be painted. To determine the amount of paint needed, the area of one side of each pane 1 needs to be calculated. Each pane 1 is 2 metres wide. An artists sketch of a pane 1 is given below. Estimates of the height of one pane 1 are made from the artists sketch. Taking x metres as the distance from the left-hand end of a pane 1 and h metres as an estimate of the height, these estimates are summarised in the table below. 0.0 0.000.5 1.601.0 1.251.5 0.852.0 0.55 a.
